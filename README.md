# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly to an element. The expected behavior is for the text to be white on a red background. However, the styles are not being rendered correctly.  The solution provides a way to fix this issue, addressing potential conflicts or configuration problems.

## Bug Report
The issue is that a seemingly correct implementation of Tailwind classes doesn't produce the expected visual result.  This is often due to issues in the build process, CSS order, conflicting stylesheets, or incorrect configuration.  See the `bug.js` file for the code demonstrating this problem.
