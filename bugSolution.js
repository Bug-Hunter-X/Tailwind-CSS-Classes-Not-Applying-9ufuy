// Ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and installed in your project.
// Check your CSS file's import order to ensure Tailwind's styles are loaded correctly.
// Verify that you have correctly added the necessary directives for Tailwind to function in your build process (e.g., PostCSS configuration).
// Remove any conflicting CSS rules that might override Tailwind's styles. Inspect the browser's developer tools to see if your styles are being overridden.
// Check for typos in your Tailwind CSS classes. Even small mistakes can prevent the classes from being applied.
// Consider simplifying your HTML structure to isolate the issue.

// Here's an example of the corrected code, demonstrating some possible fixes:
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 text-white">
  This text should now be red and white.
</div>
